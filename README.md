Router
======

A trie based HTTP router for Rails with O(log n) route recognition

## Why?

Because Journey is too hard to work with. I ran into problems adding a helpers to generate links to parent and child resources. I found it unnecessarily large and too hard to grok because of a lack of documentation.

I have a PR open on my fork of Rails to get feedback [see stevegraham/rails#1](https://github.com/stevegraham/rails/pull/1). After, I will open one on rails/rails. The router will live here if it doesn't get merged into Rails.
