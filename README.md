Router
======

A trie based HTTP router for Rack with O(log n) route recognition

## Why?

Because Journey is too hard to work with. I ran into problems adding a helpers to generate links to parent and child resources. I found it unnecessarily large and too hard to grok because of a lack of documentation.
